◦ Developed and trained a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a 30-20-10 neuron architecture on the MNIST dataset, comparing performance with Random Forest and Logistic Regression models using F1-score and confusion matrix.
◦ Conducted t-SNE visualizations of the hidden layer outputs for both trained and untrained MLP models to understand the clustering of digit representations. Applied the trained MLP to predict on the Fashion-MNIST dataset
